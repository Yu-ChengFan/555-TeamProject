# 555 Final Project

## Prerequisites
1. Install python 3.8+, check version using `python --version`
2. Instal pip, the python package manager, check version using `pip --version`
3. Install django using pip `pip install Django`
4. Verify django installed using `python -m django --version`. Should be at least 4.1
5. Clone this project, navigate to project directory
6. Install react and react Dom `npm install react react-dom`
7. Install dependencies `npm install`



## Starting up
1. Inside the project directory, you should see the module `finalproject` and `solar`. `finalproject` is django's root/parent project, and `solar` is the child app inside it. This is not that important for now.
2. To Start the app on your local machine, just run `python manage.py runserver`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:8000/solar` in your browser to view app.
3. To Stop the server, `CTRL-c` inside your terminal window.
